WPF Ephemeris Calculator by Thomas Schaschinger

With this Windows (WPF based) application you can calculate, plot and review the ephemerides at a certain point in time set by you.
You can also select a period in order to the graph the desired slot in time. Since I am very enthusiastic about Astronomy I planned
this application in order to apply my knowledge about the mathematical models used to calculate the trajectories.

## Installation
- Just clone or download the application and open it in your Visual Studio 2015 version (I have not tried it yet, but it should
also work in 2017) and install the linked nuget packages.
- Setup the MySql database with the scripts in the Database folder.

## Usage
Run the application and set the desired constraints. Click "Calculate" which will print out all the results desired. The rest
is really self explainatory.
